A list in Python is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. And in Lists duplicates are allowed and they are idexed

It can store different types of data â€” numbers, strings, booleans, even other lists.


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
mixed = [1, "hello", True, 3.14]
